# BalatroUnsteamed

Enables you to play Balatro without Steam running

## Install
Go to the game install directory and rename "luasteam.dll" to "Original.dll", then place the newly compiled "luasteam.dll" in the game directory.

## Compiling
- Balatro is an x64 executable, so please use the x64 Release config.
- Make sure you have Microsoft Detours setup correctly. I recommend using vcpkg for easy linking.
